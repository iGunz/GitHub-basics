# GitHub-basics
This repository will show you the 'embryonic basics' of GitHub such as commits, uploading files and stuff.

GitHub is actually very simple to use. It took me a few days to get used to the basic functions of it. 

If you are someone who is completely new and oblivious to GitHub then this is the place for you. Just have a look at the files.
